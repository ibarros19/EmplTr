## Description
[Main Menu](#home)

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. 

My challenge for this project was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. With that said, the user is able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their database to better organize and plan their business or projects.

## Usage
